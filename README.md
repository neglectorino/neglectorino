I'm interested in security both offensive and defensive,
cli's,
lightweight powerful tools,
super secret google cheat codes, 
scripting:python, perl, lua, vimscript, etc
just how many licks it takes to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop
42,
the kernel,
vim, tmux, netcat
microsoft bob
jack daniels
networks, sockets, modems, routers
double rainbows and other things that make me cry

things i find of interest atm, dll objects, specifically their tokens, sockets, signing certs, etc but next week it might
be port numbers and if they knoew things

like a typical short sighted jerk i more came here to learn about the things that interest me and gave very little thought
to others or the community as a whole... but ill tell you this alot of things interest me.

im part looking for a source for me to reliably reach too both in my own curated trees, as well as others, and in part im certainly here in hopes to find
others to form beneficial relationships with.

ive never really used git outside of using the cli to build repos locally generally cloned from here, but no desktop, or the gui git outside of git-bash ad git cmd

i havent had copious amounts of human interaction for a while now so im gonna leave this as is and return to it later
slightly overwhelming considering the number of people who might read this
